# Generative-Adversarial-Networks-for-Computer-Vision
Deep Neural Networks to build a generator that generates new images from noise and a discriminator function for identifying the true images from the fake images.

The file contains the code for accurately generating the MNIST handwritten images from noise and the discriminator to classify the images as fake or true.
